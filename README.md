- [ ] Minimal Spanning Tree
- [ ] Percolation
- [ ] Hex
- [ ] Hoshenâ€“Kopelman algorithm

## Graph: Undirect and Direct :world_map:	
- [ ] Graph Representation : Vertex and Edge
- [ ] Depth First Search : Stack/Recursion
- [ ] Breath First Search : Queue
- [ ] Dijkstra's Algorithm : Queue
- [ ] Topological Sort : Directed Acyclic Graph
  - a directed acyclic graph
  - Reverse DFS postorder
  - has a topological order iff no directed cycle
- [ ] Directed cycle detection 
  - cyclic inheritance : compiler does directed cycle detection
  - precedence scheduling : A directed cycle implies scheduling problem is infeasible
  - spreadsheet recalculation
